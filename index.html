            <p>
                Friends Of The Forest is an initiative for promoting Agroforestry as an alternative to conventional 
                agricultural practices in order to help in the fight against climate change.
            </p>
            <p>
                We believe nature should be treated with respect and that bringing sustainability and economic growth 
                together is not only possible but essential for guaranteeing the welfare of the next generations.

        <h2>Why Agroforestry?</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                In Brazil, over 70% of the land used for agriculture is devoted for monocultures, specially soy and maize. 
                This practice has been proved to deplete the soil from minerals resulting in desertification. 
                Harsh chemicals are used to control diseases which are easily spread in monocultures. It also causes a loss of 
                the biodiversity of the region due to the removal of native vegetation in order to optimize 
                the production of grains.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite Brazil being one of the biggest food producing countries, over 60 million Brazilians face food insecurity. 
                Most of the grains produced in monocultures is destined to exportation. Also, around 
                70% of what Brazilians eat every day is produced by small family run farms.
            </p>
            <p>
                Agroforestry can help us solve these issues. By interacting nature and agriculture, we can produce high quality 
                food without destabilizing native systems. By copying natural process, the need for pesticides and other harsh chemicals 
                is drastically reduced. In addition, the variety of plants and animals created in this type of agriculture can help meet 
                most needs of the local population.
